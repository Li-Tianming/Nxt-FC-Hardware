## Caution!!!!!!!!

### V1.2.0

### V1.0.0

In the v1.0.1 design, the original concept was to create an unusual ESC connector in order to prompt users to notice the pinout sequence. However, in practice, the placement of the Rx pin in close proximity to the Vbat pin resulted in MCU damage during power on/off if the cable was not tightly installed (causing a high voltage spark). Realizing this issue, the v1.1.0 design changed the ESC pinout order to address this problem.

If you are using v1.0.1 of the NxtPX4 flight controller (which can be found at the back of the PCB), it is important to pay attention to your connection with the ESC. Specifically, it is recommended that you do not disconnect or connect the NxtPX4 while the ESC is already powered on, as this can cause damage to the flight controller.
